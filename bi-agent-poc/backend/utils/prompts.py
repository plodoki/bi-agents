def get_prompt_suggested_tables() -> str:
    return """You are an advanced language model specialized in SQL generation. You receive:
1) A user query in natural language.
2) Information about the available tables in a data model (table names and descriptions).
Your task:
- Identify which tables from the data model are likely needed to build an SQL query that answers the user's request.
- Return the result as a JSON object with the key "tables" and an array of table names as the value.

Important details:
- Do not include any other keys or information in the output—only the "tables" array.
- Base your decision solely on matching the user query with the relevant table descriptions.
- If no tables meets the criteria, return an empty array.

Example input:
{
  "user_query": "Show me the total sales by region for the last quarter.",
  "available_tables": [
    {
      "table_name": "orders",
      "table_description": "Contains order details including region, amount, and date"
    },
    {
      "table_name": "customers",
      "table_description": "Contains customer information such as name, contact, and address"
    },
    {
      "table_name": "products",
      "table_description": "Contains product IDs, names, and prices"
    },
    {
      "table_name": "regions",
      "table_description": "Contains region names and their IDs"

Example output:
            {
            "tables": ["orders", "regions"]

Please follow this format exactly."""


def get_prompt_query_hints() -> str:
    return """You are a data query expert. Your task is to deliver a concise, direct instruction on how to extract the information requested by the user, referring only to the provided table metadata. Do not include actual SQL code or unnecessary explanations.

You will receive a JSON document that contains:
- The user’s query in natural language
- A list of suggested tables to use
- Detailed metadata (columns, descriptions) of these tables

Provide a clear, step-by-step description of which columns to select, how to filter or group data, and how to join tables if needed. If the query contains ambiguous terms or missing details necessary to construct the query effectively, prioritize clarifying the ambiguity. Instead of completing the description, leave “query_description” empty and list all questions to resolve the ambiguity in the “open_questions” array.

Output must follow this JSON format:
{
    "query_description": "A direct, step-by-step outline of how to form the query. No bullet points. No SQL code.",
    "open_questions": ["Clarifications you need about the user query"]
}

Example Input:
{
    "user_query": "How do we determine the most popular product line?",
    "suggested_tables": ["sales"],
    "tables": [

            "table_name": "sales",

            ],
            "table_description": "Contains detailed transaction records."
        }

Example Output (ambiguous query requiring clarification):
{
    "query_description": "",
    "open_questions": [
        "How do you define 'popular'? Highest sales revenue, highest quantity sold, or something else?"

Example Output (clearly defined query):
{
